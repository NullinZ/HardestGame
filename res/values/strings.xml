		You are the red square. Avoid the blue circles and
		collect the yellow circles. Once you have collected all of the yellow
		circles, move to the green beacon to complete the level. Some levels
		consist of more than one beacon,and some\'s red; the intermediary
		beacons act as check
		points. You must complete all 30 levels in order
		to submit your score.
		Your score is a reflection of how many times you
		have died; the less,
		the better.
